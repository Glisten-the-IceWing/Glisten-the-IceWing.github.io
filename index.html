  <h1>Peril, Wings of Fire</h1>
  <p>Peril is one of the first dragon the <span class="wrap-text"> <i>Dragonets of Destiny</i> </span> meet when they escape their cave home. (and gets her crush on Clay, the only dragon that can toucher safely) She is also part of the <u>Jade winglet</u>, where Turtle becomes a good friend of hers, in a brother sister kind of way. Peril is a firescales, which means well, che has fire in her scales. anything she touches (that is flammable) will <b>BURN</b>. So when she touches dragons, they burn. Her mother, Kestrel, was ordered by Queen Scarlet to destroy her defecrive egg, which had two dragonets in it, but she fled. Once Queen Scarlet cought up with Kestrel, the egg had hatched.one of the dragonets, Peril, had to much fire, but the other, Sky, had to little. the Queen ordered Kestrel to kill one of her dragonets then she could live in the kingdom safeley, but kestrel faked it and threw her dragonet in the river, planning to find him the next day. After that, the Queen changed her mind and told her to kill her other dragonet, but Kestrel refused and tried to get away, but  the firescales burned her too bad, leaving Peril to the Queens mercy. instead of executing her, Scarlet had her be be her champion for her arena, where later the dragonets of destiny were captured and forced to fight to the death, where Peril rescued them. Sky was found by a scavenger (human) and Kestrel never found him again.</p>
